# Advanced Indoor Positioning System for Wheelchairs

This project develops an advanced indoor positioning system for tracking wheelchairs in a multi-floor hospital using IoT-based RFID technology. It ensures real-time tracking and reporting of wheelchairs' locations in terms of room and floor numbers, enhancing operational efficiency and patient service.

## Objectives

- **RFID Tracking**: Utilize RFID sensors and tags for accurate and real-time tracking of wheelchairs.
- **Location Reporting**: Provide wheelchair locations in terms of room numbers and floor levels in a four-floor hospital.
- **User Interface**: Design an intuitive and scalable UI for managing and displaying tracking data, accommodating multiple wheelchairs.

## Features

- **RFID Sensors**: Track wheelchairs by reading RFID tags placed on them and sensors installed at room entries and exits.
- **Indoor Positioning**: Report locations based on a unique floormap with rotational adjustments for each floor.
- **UI Design**: A single, scalable interface for tracking data management and display, designed for ease of use and adaptability.
- **Floor Mapping**: Each floor has a unique map with five asymmetric rooms, rotated by 90° from the previous floor’s layout.

## Components

- **RFID Sensors**: Installed at room entry and exit points.
- **RFID Tags**: Attached to wheelchairs for identification.
- **User Interface**: Developed to manage and visualize tracking data efficiently.
- **Indoor Mapping**: Custom-designed floormaps for accurate location reporting.

## Conclusion

The system significantly improves hospital operations by enabling precise tracking of wheelchairs, leading to better equipment management and timely service. The intuitive UI ensures easy data management and scalability, enhancing overall operational efficiency.
